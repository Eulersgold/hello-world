# hello-world

Let's see. My first job was mowing my grandparent's lawn when I was in junior high. They paid me 20 bucks to mow their front and back lawns, which took me about 2 hours (they had a huge house). 

My next job was working for them in their print shop in Chico. They were a very successful small business in an age before the internet. They printed and published for a wide variety of customers, and were best known for printing the majority of the nation's school student ID cards for junior highs and high schools.

When I was a senior in high school, I took a job at Arby's in Chico where at 18 I become a shift leader. This was my first management job. At 18. 

Then I worked for a video rental store I had rented from my entire life. It was a sweet job but got boring fast, so I quit.

The next job I took was at a grocery store, where I worked graveyard shift helping stockers clear cardboard and facing product. Eventually I got to stock and became a combo clerk. I left that job because they cut my hours so that I lost benefits. 

Next I used my typing skills to gain a job doing data entry for Blue Shield and Medicare. Despite working there for over 3 years, I never felt like that job taught me anything and it took over 2 years to get my first raise... which was 30 cents.

Next I worked at United Healthcare as a customer service rep. This was one of my least favorite jobs. The benefits were good though.

I went back to work for Medicare, but this time under my friend's dad. It was a fun and easy job I was good at working in their warehouse. I actually got paid more as a temp than I did after 3 years working there as a data entry clerk.

After this my soon to be wife and I moved to Portland Oregon. I worked at a few places as a temp for a week here or there in warehouses, until a data entry job popped up at a freight payables firm. This was a great job. First job, since my grandparent's print shop that I got to attend a Christmas party. 

We moved back to Chico and I worked as a landscaper. This job brought me back to my origins, and honestly, was one of the most fun jobs I've ever had. I really enjoyed the crew I worked with, but our manager was a jerk. I still felt it was worth the brief time we did it.

We moved to Seattle Washington so my wife could be a chef (she's very talented). I worked as a contractor for WaMu before they went out of business. Seeing a gigantic monstor corporation die from the inside taught me a great deal. The first year I worked as a billing clerk, and quickly was promoted to accounts payable manager. 

I want to touch on this more because this role is essentially the role that got me to where I am today. It taught me how to deal with mean and challenging customers. It taught me what it truly meant to be used by your corporation, given that I worked insanely long hours for limited pay, in Seattle which was incredibly expensive. 

After all I did, they laid me off once WaMu went under, despite having plenty of work near where I was moving back to.

When I got back to Chico, shortly following the birth of my daughter, I went back to school and earned an AS in Biology. I used this degree to pursue mathematics, which essentially led me to my favorite job I've ever had.

I worked in the rice fields of Northern California for 3 seasons doing experiments for UC Davis. It was hard work, but good paying and fun. This job gave me the skills I needed for my future.

I worked for Build.com for 4 years, 7 months. The first 2 years I worked there were the happiest I'd ever experienced at a place of business. The rest was a disaster.
We were basically stooges for merchandisers who walked all over us and had no respect for our sucess, despite us holding onto a gigantic amount of information that they simply refused to use. 

Now I work at a wonderful small startup in the fin-tech field. I am very happy, albeit sometimes bored, but I believe in this company and hope we can turn it into a monster. I don't think I'll work for a souless corporation again.
